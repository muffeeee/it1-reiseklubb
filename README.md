A project I made in IT1 class. I didn't spend a whole lot of time on this.. :b

## Installation
Firstly, download node.js. Please refer to the [node.js website](http://nodejs.org) for more information.

To start the server on port 3000, simply run `node app.js` from a Linux terminal or Command Prompt.
